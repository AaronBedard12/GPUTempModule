# GPUTempModule
This is my first kernel module, so this will be a documentation of my learning. I am resources such as https://lwn.net/Kernel/LDD3/ and https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linux-unix/linux-kernel-module-programming-hello-world-program/

At the point of creating this repository, I have been working on this for about 4 weeks already, mainly wokring on getting a basic module running using DKMS to build.

I fixed the make file so that DKMS is no longer needed to run the module.
